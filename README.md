# Java-Module-2-ArrayList-Grades
1. Write a program using an ArrayList of several evaluations from
computer science in high school.
2. Fill the list with sample ratings.
3. Then use a for loop to calculate the student's average grade (mean
arithmetic), but in such a way that extreme evaluations will be omitted - ONE
smallest and ONE largest.
Find the highest and smallest values. For example, for ratings:
1. 3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6 - the following grades will be taken to calculate the average: 3,4,4,4,5,5,5
2. 4,4,4,4,4,4,4 - the following grades will be taken to calculate the average: 4,4,4,4,4
